# Kitty in the box!

This lesson will help you learn how to combine some Javascript with HTML and CSS! And it'll be fun!

#### Steps:

#### HTML/CSS
1. Put a picture of a cat in the middle of the page! 
2. Put a big colored box around the cat picture (with a border!)

#### Javascript
3. Now, with Javascript, create a feature where clicking on the cat picture will change the cat picture to a DIFFERENT one (choose from more than 2!)
4. BONUS: Decide randomly which cat pictures get shown on each click!
5. BONUS: Make the border box change colors randomly too with each click!
